1. Copy the run.bat file and place it in the same folder as the program.cpp file.
2. Open a command prompt at the location where the program.cpp file is located and use 'run'
```

## Instructions for using the program

Navigation keys

Notes
```
  1. In the input material code box of the expression to add invoice details, you can use the right arrow key to display a list of material selection instead of having to enter it manually.
